Research Plan

Following on from my work on the ND280 software, where I helped look at the different
options for the software’s version control, its package naming and the implementation of
ROOT6, I plan to help with the transition of the software from the CVS repositories to
GitLab. This will include implementing validation tests that check any uploaded code to
ensure the software still runs correctly. I’m in a good position to carry out this work as I
have access to the COMET repositories on GitLab and I’m in contact with several COMET
collaborators that can give advice on how they transitioned to GitLab. It is still to be decided
whether a CVS build will be kept frozen or developed alongside the GitLab repositories, in
which case it could be my duty to transfer data added to the CVS version to GitLab.
I am becoming familiar with the new Super-FGD detector to be installed for the ND280
upgrade in ∼2 years. I assisted with the beam test of the prototype at CERN, which involved
assembling the electronics of the detector and taking data with the detector during the test.
This could lead on to me helping with the analysis of the data from the beam test.
